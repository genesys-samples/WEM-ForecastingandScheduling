## About Forecasting & Scheduling in Genesys Cloud CX
Genesys Cloud CX forecasts for both voice and digital channels that route through queues. While there are multiple types of forecasting available, we will be focusing our efforts today on the AI-powered Automatic Best Method Selection. To read more about what makes this type of forecast special, navigate to this resource article. https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/automatic-best-method-forecast-method-overview/ 

Once a forecast is created for a certain period, schedules can then be generated based on that forecast. Schedule generation uses data from a short-term forecast along with week- and day-level scheduling constraints to produce a weekâ€™s schedule. Administrators will schedule generation from forecasting to return predicted service performance that closely matches requirements with as few paid hours as possible. Let's get started

1. Navigate to the Forecasts page from the Genesys Cloud Admin console
