## Welcome to our workshop on forecasting and scheduling with Genesys Cloud CX

In this workshop, you'll be wearing the hat of a Genesys Cloud CX Workforce Administrator. After completing the first-time setup to create your teams, service targets, and ultimately a schedule we will then give you a few scenarios that a WFM Admin might run into. You'll then get to put on your agent hat and view your schedule, request some time off, and request a shift trade with a colleague.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the Genesys Cloud CX WFM terminology
- Learn how to setup the WFM suite to generate a forecast and a schedule
- Learn how to reschedule if there are changes in a contact center
- Understand the relationships between Service Goal Templates, Planning Groups, and Forecasts
- Learn how agents can interact with a WFM schedule
