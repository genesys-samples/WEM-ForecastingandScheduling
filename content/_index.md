## Welcome to our workshop on forecasting and scheduling with Genesys Cloud CX

This is part 1 of 2 in our WEM series. In this workshop, you'll be wearing the hat of a Genesys Cloud CX Workforce Administrator. After completing the first-time setup to create your teams, service targets, and ultimately a schedule we will then give you a few scenarios that a WFM Admin might run into. You'll then get to put on your agent hat and view your schedule, request some time off, and request a shift trade with a colleague.

It's important to note that this is mostly a follow-along workshop. We recommended that you review the information in our resource center about our Workforce Management capabilities as we will not cover everything in this workshop. https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-workforce-management/
