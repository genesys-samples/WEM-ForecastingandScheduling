### Interacting with Schedules as an Agent

Now that we have successfully created our schedule and published it, we will now take a look at the agents perspective of viewing and interacting with their schedule.

In this section, we will review how to view and access an agents schedule as well as how to perform tasks like requesting time off and requesting shift trades. These actions can be performed within the Tempo App, developed by Genesys as well as within the Genesys CX UI.
