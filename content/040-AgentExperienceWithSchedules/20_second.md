## Requesting a Shift Trade

If the manager or super has enabled shift trading and configured the parameters around which types of trades are allowed, agents can then request shift trades through in the schedule view, or in the Tempo App. For today, we will focus on the UI schedule view (The process in tempo is identical)

To recap, our agent wants to see if there are any shifts available to take for tuesday the 31st and trade the scheduled shift on the 1st.

To begin this process the agent would navigate to the top right hand side and lick the shift trade button to view any offered trade dates, pending approvals and completed trades.

Next, we start to browse for available shifts that can be traded. We begin by starting a new trade and browsing available trades.

We can then see that an agent has posted a shift for trade for the date we are interested in working that matches all pre-configured parameters allowing shift trades between agents. We will select the date we are looking for, and see what shift times have been posted. Once we find the shift we like, we can select it and move forward!

Once we have selected the shift we would like to trade, we can finalize the process and submit the trade request.

When the request is submitted, it will show as pending until it is approved by a supervisor or someone with permissions to do so.

## Approving Shift Trades

Once the shift trade has been submitted, it will be pending approval from a supervisor or someone with supervisory permissions before the trade is approved and the shift trade has gone into effect.

Once the shift trade has been requested, the supervisor is notified through the unified inbox and can navigate directly to the approval window. 

First we click into the unified inbox, and onto Shift trade requests where we can see the shift trade we submitted has arrived and is pending approval.

Once we click view details, it will bring us to the workforce management view of pending shift trades. 

> Note: You can also navigate here from: Admin > Workforce Management > Shift Trades

Once we approve the trade request, the agent will be notified that there is a change to their schedule and will then be reflected in the schedule view

Now, as the agent, we can return to the schedule view to see that we are now on shift for Tuesday the 31st!
