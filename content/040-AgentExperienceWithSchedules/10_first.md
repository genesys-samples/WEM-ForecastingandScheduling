## Viewing Schedules in Genesys UI


There are several ways for an agent to view their schedule within the single pane of glass experience offered by the unified Genesys UI. To start, we will begin as an agent would logging in for the first time monday morning. Upon logging into the Genesys UI, the agent would find themselves within the activity view of, showcasing everything from gamification, quality management and WFM.

Below, we can see schedule along with coaching appointments, score card summary and assigned modules as a part of our native learning and development capabilities. For today, we will be focusing on our schedule.

Once we click "view full schedule" We will be brought to the main schedule page available for agents. Within this view, agents are able to view schedules for the week and future weeks.In this view, we can see schedules separated by Today, Day, week and month. The agent can also perform tasks from this view, such as requesting days off, trading shifts, and even sharing their calendar to external resource.

Additionally, they will have an "out of Adherence" notification if they are showing to be in a different status from what they are scheduled to be in. Adherence is configurable to be as strict or lenient as needed within the contact centers scheduling requirements and is reportable for supervisors who have permission to view the data.

In the Image below, we can see our schedule view. Our scenario today will lead to requesting PTO and shift trades.

## Viewing Agent Schedules in Tempo

Another way to see our schedule is through the Genesys Tempo App. This app is designed to give agents a view of their schedule, trade shifts, request time off and even notify their employer that they may be running late to their shift.

In the schedule view above, we notice that we are not scheduled for Tuesday the 31st however, are scheduled for the following day. With a busy agent life, I'd like to see if someone can take my shift so I might be able to attend one of the Genesys events happening that day. In the next section, we will go over trading shifts to see how an agent can make this happen!
