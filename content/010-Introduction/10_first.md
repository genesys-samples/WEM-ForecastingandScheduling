### Before Getting Started

One part of forecasting that is crucially important is solid data. Genesys Cloud CX offers the most sophisticated methodology in WFM using the interaction data that has taken place in your Genesys Cloud CX organization. Automatic Best Method Forecasting includes: 
- Built-in, automated capabilities for historical data cleanup
- Outlier and calendar effect identification
- Pattern detection including seasonality and trends
- Best-of-best modeling to select from 20+ methodologies including ARIMA, WM, Decomp

Of course, not all of us following along in this workshop are using a Genesys Cloud CX organization that has lots of data. If you fall in that boat where you don't have much data, Genesys Cloud CX offers a Historical Data Import that allows you to forecast for some data. If you have a couple of queues in your organization that you can use their data for forecasting, please skip this next section. 

### Get Some Data in Your Org
*Heads up: In this part of the workshop, you'll be importing data using the Historical Data Import feature. This feature runs the import at 3 am nightly. If you do need to do this section, you'll need to stop this workshop and continue the next day when the import is successful*
