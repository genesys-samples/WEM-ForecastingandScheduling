### Introduction 
The ultimate goal of today's workshop is to teach you how to appropriately schedule agents in Genesys Cloud CX. There are a few ways to generate schedules in Genesys Cloud: creating a blank schedule, generating a load-based schedule based on a forecast and creating a schedule without a forecast. 

We'll focus today on generating a load-based schedule with our AI-powered forecasting algorithm. In this workshop, you'll see the steps necessary to create a schedule based on an AI-powered forecast.
